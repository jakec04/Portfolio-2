I'm a Chicago-based journalist and digital producer studying at DePaul University, graduating June 2026. I serve as Digital Managing Editor at The DePaulia, where I combine data, web presentation and news editing to build products that engage readers.

I pioneered the live blog format for breaking news coverage, led a website redesign and grew newsletter audience sixfold. I'm also a newsletter intern at Block Club Chicago, creating daily emails that connect readers with local stories while contributing coverage and audience strategy.

I'm earning a geographic information systems certificate to strengthen my data reporting skills and am excited to bring my passion for local journalism, data and audience engagement to any newsroom.
